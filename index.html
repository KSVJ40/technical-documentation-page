                        <li>Neural Networks: Neural networks consist of interconnected nodes called neurons, organized in layers. They are designed to process and learn from complex patterns and relationships in data. Neural networks are composed of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer.</li>
                        <li><strong>Layers:</strong> Layers are a fundamental building block of neural networks. Each layer is made up of a group of neurons. The three main types of layers are:</li>
                            <ul>
                            <li> Input Layer: The input layer receives the initial data or features from the input source and passes them to the subsequent layers.</li>
                            <li> Hidden Layers: Hidden layers are intermediate layers that perform computations using weighted connections from the previous layer. They are responsible for extracting and transforming features in the data.</li>
                            <li>Output Layer: The output layer produces the final predictions or outputs of the neural network. The number of neurons in the output layer depends on the nature of the task (e.g., classification, regression).</li>
                            </ul>
                            <li><strong>Activation Functions:</strong>Activation functions introduce non-linearities to the neural network, enabling it to learn complex relationships between inputs and outputs. Each neuron in a neural network typically applies an activation function to the weighted sum of its inputs before passing the result to the next layer. Common activation functions include:</li>
                            <ul>
                            <li><strong>Sigmoid:</strong> The sigmoid function maps the input to a value between 0 and 1, which is useful for binary classification problems.</li>
                            <li>ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit): ReLU sets all negative values to zero and keeps positive values unchanged. It helps with the network's ability to learn and avoids the vanishing gradient problem.</li>
                            <li>Tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent): The tanh function maps the input to a value between -1 and 1. It is useful for classification tasks with two or more classes.</li>
                            <li><strong>Softmax:</strong> The softmax function is often used in the output layer for multi-class classification problems. It converts the output values into a probability distribution over the classes.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </ol>
                    </li><li  id="h"><strong>Overview of popular deep learning architectures (e.g., convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks)</strong></li>
                    <ol>
                    <li>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): CNNs are widely used for image and video analysis tasks. They are designed to automatically learn and extract hierarchical patterns and features from visual data. CNNs consist of convolutional layers that apply filters to input images, followed by pooling layers for downsampling and reducing spatial dimensions. They are effective in tasks such as image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.</li>
                    <li>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): RNNs are suitable for processing sequential data, such as text or time series. Unlike feedforward neural networks, RNNs have recurrent connections that allow information to persist over time. This enables them to capture dependencies and patterns in sequential data. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) are popular variations of RNNs that address the vanishing gradient problem and improve the modeling of long-term dependencies.</li>
                    <li>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): GANs consist of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, that compete against each other. The generator generates synthetic data samples, while the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and fake samples. Through iterative training, GANs learn to generate realistic and high-quality synthetic data. GANs have been successful in tasks like image synthesis, text generation, and style transfer.</li>
                    <li>Transformer Networks: Transformer networks have revolutionized natural language processing tasks. They employ a self-attention mechanism that allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence when making predictions. Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art results in tasks such as machine translation, language understanding, and text generation. The popular model known as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is based on the transformer architecture.</li>
                    <li>Autoencoders: Autoencoders are neural networks used for unsupervised learning and dimensionality reduction. They consist of an encoder that compresses the input data into a lower-dimensional representation (latent space), and a decoder that reconstructs the original input from the latent space. Autoencoders are used for tasks like data denoising, anomaly detection, and feature extraction.</li>
